But Howard Barker\u2019s new foes are liberals \u2013 angry at the \u2018yellowface\u2019 casting in his latest work. Why is he so unbothered?At the bottom of the Brighton street where Howard Barker lives is the seafront house that once belonged to Terence Rattigan. It is hard to imagine two more contrasting English dramatists. Rattigan wrote elegant dramas of the English upper classes, including The Deep Blue Sea and The Winslow Boy, that have become standards of the West End and National Theatre. Barker writes jagged epics that reimagine history, geography and language: The Castle is a version of the Crusades, while Victory fictionalises the English civil war. Although Barker is feted in France \u2013 one production there has been running for two years \u2013 he has only once been performed at the National: Scenes from an Execution, about a 16th-century Italian painter commissioned to glorify a war victory, was revived there five years ago.

Rising is what God put the middle classes on Earth to do. In fact, according to this illuminating study, they have now risen to the point where they outnumber the working class.Whether this is true depends of course on how you define these categories. One might also wonder how much size matters. Marx thought that the proletariat would overthrow capitalism, but he did not think that this was because it formed a majority of the population. In fact, he was well aware that factory workers did not even constitute the majority of the working class, let alone of the nation as a whole. Most working people in Victorian Britain were domestic servants, of whom a large majority were women. Most of those who laboured in Marx\u2019s day were not blue-collar male but white-petticoated female. The word proletariat derives from the Latin word for offspring, meaning those who were too poor to serve the state with anything but the potential workers they produced from their wombs. Today, in a world of postcolonial sweatshops and agricultural labour, the typical proletarian is still a woman.

He carved David, painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and did a few other things. In Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s brilliant TV drama The Young Pope, a copy of his Last Judgement formed a sinister backdrop to Jude Law\u2019s pontifical pronouncements; Michelangelo is a god of art. But who is Sebastiano, and why has he got a joint exhibition with one of the greatest artists who ever lived? He is Sebastiano del Piombo (about 1485-1547), the great nearly-man of the Italian High Renaissance. He was almost one of the very greatest Venetian painters, then moved to Rome where was he was overshadowed by Raphael and dominated by Michelangelo. Perhaps personal modesty held him back; perhaps he was not quite driven enough to compete in an age of intense artistic individualism. Yet his paintings offer tantalising evidence of true genius.

Close Relations is about relations growing further apart: the divided loyalties that have come painfully to the surface in Ukraine. It tracks the period from May 2014 \u2013 just after the anti-Russian Euromaidan moment \u2013 to May 2015, when Ukraine finds itself in an eastern war with pro-Russian secessionist rebels, and also finds that Russia has annexed Crimea. Mansky is Ukrainian born but a Russian resident since his student days in the Soviet era and he feels a strong sense that Russian sympathies are an authentic, longstanding Ukrainian tradition. It is almost the equivalent of unionism in Northern Ireland, and in one testy conversation, the situation is compared to the Kurds and Turkey, with the Russian rebels in the Kurdish role. Yet pro-Russian sympathies are clouded by a resentment of Vladimir Putin\u2019s nationalism and bully-ism. Conversely, Ukrainian nationalism and a yearning to join the EU are compromised by memories of the wartime Ukrainian nationalist Stepan Bandera, who was associated with Nazi Germany. With a subdued, almost conspiratorially whispery voiceover, Mansky travels the country visiting his relatives.

Books of notable Georgians in England go straight from Hawke to Haydon. In Boswell\u2019s Life of Samuel Johnson he hardly appears, despite having been a great friend of Johnson\u2019s in the 1740s, as well as his colleague at the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine. Even his only biographer says that Hawkesworth \u201cdid not leave a mark visible across the centuries\u201d. But you will notice I said \u201cthe case of\u201d John Hawkesworth, the point being that his literary career closely resembles a cautionary tale. His story is one of ambition and pride; overreaching and disaster. Students of writing are doubtless told that a bad review won\u2019t kill you. They are probably also taught that vindictive, envious trolling is a spanking new phenomenon. The extraordinary case of John Hawkesworth disproves both these little platitudes.So what did he do? Most notably, he was commissioned by the Admiralty to write up James Cook\u2019s 1769-1771 voyage aboard the Endeavour. The expedition had the scientific goal of observing the transit of Venus from Tahiti, but Cook also carried sealed orders to continue from Tahiti and search for the great southern continent. With astonishing skill, he mapped the entire coast of New Zealand, and then the eastward limit of New Holland (or Australia). On board the ship was the aristocratic botanist Joseph Banks, along with other scientists and artists, many of whom kept their own sea journals. On their return there was considerable public interest in Cook\u2019s discoveries. What was needed was a collation of the journals, and as the nominated author of the proposed work (full title: An Account of the Voyages Undertaken by the Order of His Present Majesty for Making Discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere), Hawkesworth was fully aware he had hit pay dirt. He promptly sold the rights for \u00a36,000 \u2013 an absolutely vast amount of money.

First, there\u2019s Michael Chabon\u2019s Moonglow (Fourth Estate). Taking in radicalism and rocket science, this is a wildly inventive and often very funny novel, and such a relief after its tedious predecessor, Telegraph Avenue. Speaking of tedious, Jonathan Lethem\u2019s career has never quite regained the heights of Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude. The Blot (Jonathan Cape), out in February, tells of a telepathic backgammon shark with a brain tumour. It\u2019s a return to form, absurd and digressive in a way that makes clear Lethem\u2019s debt to Thomas Pynchon. Finally, and most surprisingly, there\u2019s Paul Auster\u2019s 4321 (Faber). Auster is 70 in 2017, which shocked me rather \u2013 I still think of him as a sprightly iconoclast. His new novel is so much better than anything since The Music of Chance, you wonder if it can really be by the same author as Invisible or Oracle Night. This meticulously plotted book weaves four possible stories out of the life of one man \u2013 Ferguson \u2013 who makes his way through the second half of the 20th century being buffeted by forces political and personal. Think a postmodern take on Kate Atkinson\u2019s Life After Life.One\u2019s heart goes out to the contemporary American novelist, for whom daily reality seems to outstrip the reach of both satire and dystopia. All the more impressive that a debutant, Nathan Hill, with his scintillating The Nix (Picador), has given us a character who comes close to out-Trumping Trump. Sheldon Packer is a bilious demagogue, just one of the many pleasures of this engaging story of a mother and son whose private travails become front-page news. Other first novels worth looking out for are Sympathy (One) by Olivia Sudjic, the best fictional account I\u2019ve read of the way the internet has shaped our inner lives. A literary thriller that confirms the arrival of a major new talent. There\u2019s also The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times (Salt) by Xan Brooks \u2013 a fairytale wrapped within a historical novel, it\u2019s as quixotic and dreamlike as Ishiguro\u2019s The Buried Giant. Elif Batuman\u2019s memoir of a life in love with Russian literature, The Possessed, was stunning and her first novel, The Idiot (Cape), is just as good \u2013 a moving, continent-hopping coming-of-age story.

Scott was a veteran of the Australian rock scene \u2013 he\u2019d sung with the Spektors, the Valentines and Fraternity without ever reaching any level of real success. He\u2019d also worked in a fertiliser plant, and in May 1974 had a motorcycle accident \u2013 riding drunk after a row \u2013 that left him in a coma for three days. So, 28 years old by the time he joined AC/DC, he was well acquainted with the vicissitudes of life, and quite how long the way to the top was if you wanted to rock\u2019n\u2019roll. The anger at spending years on the fringes and the joy at getting another shot burst through in his lyrics in the early AC/DC records. The group\u2019s first Australian album, High Voltage, came out in February 1975, but their second, TNT (released in December of the same year) was where Scott really found his voice. It opened with It\u2019s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll) and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Singer, which were pretty much Scott\u2019s manifestoes of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll life \u2013 grubby, dirty, venal, but a whole lot better than the alternative. \u201cWell you can stick your nine-to-five living / And your collar and your tie / And you can stick your moral standards / \u2019Cos it\u2019s all a dirty lie,\u201d he sings on Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Singer, those last two words given an almost camp inflection. (It\u2019s often overlooked that Scott was, at his best, an excellent lyric writer, and \u2013 just as important \u2013 brilliant at phrasing in his delivery.)

The way I see it, we\u2019re all unreliable narrators of our lives who usually have absolute trust in our self-told stories. Any truth is, after all, just a matter of perspective. The only rule I have in how I let characters tell stories is that they must always tell the reader their version of the truth. No one likes being outright lied to, even in fiction. I don\u2019t mind a narrator who\u2019s self-deceiving, but the clues for their truth have to be there for the reader to see.My novel Behind Her Eyes is, on the surface, the story of the three people in a love affair. An affair combined with a marriage built on secrets \u2013 which there must be in a thriller \u2013 is perfect for creating unreliable narrators.

Though Craigroyston to be fair, has been reborn in a different location. Do you think Cameron, Millibandy, or their pals could make such a claim? My real question is on disappointment, in that do you feel disappointed for how it\u2019s all turned out? During the 60s and 70s in amongst all the crap there was at least a sense of optimism, a glimmer of things getting better, of our society becoming a bit more equal. Around 1975 ish, in my early 20s as a lad from Pilton I sipped sherry one Xmas or some such with admiral Denning, or his brother the Lord one, who had a dose of the horrors when he discovered I was a prol. But at least I got in past the front door. Q. Is it all now stitched up to prevent prols from ever sherry sipping with Lords and Admirals?It is. It has gone back to a kind of Victorian type of society, and it's almost like all the advances after the second world war, all the social advances, have been eradicated. We've gone back to a very elitist ideology, and it's disappointing. Everything's also a reaction though: the new narrative of our time is the new nation state, self-sufficient, eco-friendly, socially progressive. And that's what's going to facilitate real change: not bureaucracies like the EU, not corrupt elitist parliaments like Westminster.

Either I ran with the pack, which I've photographed in the Observer, or I tried to stay on the straight and narrow and eventually escape what was a really violent ghetto at the time. It was by the fortune of this one sunny day that I took my camera and photographed the boys in this derelict building at the end of my street. I took this photo to the Observer newspaper, the editor asked: Did you take this? I said: yes. And they published it. And gave me \u00a350 and it was a king's ransom, the turning point of my whole life. It offered me a life away from the bigotry and ignorance and violence of Finsbury Park. And since then I've managed to publish 30 books, numerous exhibitions. But the final footnote is that I failed my photography test to becomes a RAF photographer. I taught myself everything about photography and darkroom work. It was all based on the foundations of a terrible beginning in my life. I've managed to turn it all around and be where I am.What I do is I thin down the hard part by putting all my energy into the trying part of processing the film, making beautiful prints. I don't disassociate, I always retain the memory of what I've seen because the memory becomes my white stick, it guides me into the next stage, into the darkroom and releasing my emotions into the print. It might be darker, more sinister. A lot of fear went into my work, I saw dead children, men with their jaws blown away, holes in their throat. This had to be got rid of or I would have post-traumatic stress. Which I don't. But I do have bad dreams. I took my soul and my stress into the darkroom. I belong to this system I've developed.

Could you tell us how much of an influence the blues have had on you, and which bluesmen in particular as well as Big Bill Broonzy please?The American blues in the South was a profound influence on me. One of my most cherished awards is that I'm a Blues Ambassador of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when I was presented the Slim Harpo award. I think it's the simplicity - as I said earlier, it's a protest forum, that can touch on very emotive issues, for example Big Bill Broonzy's If You're Black Get Back Get Back was incredible important for its time. But you don't have to be from the American South to be a bluesman. One of my great friends and inspirations was a man called Davey Graham, who I believe was mixed race but sang the blues in an almost London accent. No American affectation whatsover. And he still conveyed the emotions of the blues without resorting to the American accent. When the Kinks first started we were often reported as saying we sing blues, but we don't sing in American accents. We tried to retain our Englishness.Davey Graham was from Scotland I believe.

Recently, I was in a cinema when the trailer for T2, the new Trainspotting film, was played. The whole room erupted into cheers. Perhaps your excitement is not as delirious. There are many who are dismissing the film before it\u2019s even been screened. But I have a feeling that your anticipation levels are linked to how you spent your 1990s. Trainspotting, the 1996 original, remains the quintessential mid-90s movie. Like Oasis and Blur, like Kate Moss and love doves and Firestarter, it was of its time and captured that time\u2019s cynical yet optimistic, hedonistic heart. Though the story was about heroin addicts, the feel of the film recalled different drugs: uppers, hallucinogens, ecstasy. There were real-unreal trippy sequences about losing pills in a toilet or going cold turkey; uplifting, rushy ones about clubbing and having sex. Plus fantastic music: Iggy Pop, Primal Scream, Leftfield. Trainspotting wasn\u2019t shallow, but it didn\u2019t dwell; it was always moving, like a long, clever pop video.The characters were people you felt you already knew. There was Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle, the booze-fuelled, unpredictable psycho, a small-town Scottish version of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas. Spud (Ewen Bremner): hapless, surreal, a lovable, smackhead loser. Sexy Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), out for whatever he could get, mostly women and drugs. And Renton, played by Ewan McGregor, the heroined-up antihero, who kept kicking drugs and then going back, and doing the same to his mates, until he finally robbed them all (except Spud) and ran away. What\u2019s remarkable about Trainspotting is that even if you haven\u2019t watched the film in years (I hadn\u2019t), you\u2019ll remember each character\u2019s defining scene. Begbie\u2019s was the freeze-frame where he chucked a beer glass over his shoulder into a packed pub. Spud\u2019s was the whizzed-up job interview (\u201cmy pleasure in other people\u2019s leisure\u201d) and the unfortunate bedclothes-across-the-breakfast-table moment. Sick Boy, the slipperiest of a selection of born-slippy characters: snogging a girl with an E on his tongue.

And no, there are no special options because you chose an IVA over being declared bankrupt \u2013 both are still forms of insolvency. An IVA is a formal agreement to repay your creditors at an amount you can afford. If your creditors agree to the IVA it becomes legally binding.

Reuse targets would be a good start for this. We do our impact figures at Remade based on the number of people we teach to fix things and how many items won't be bought, that otherwise would be. We want to see a shift to a much more dematerialised economy with a growth in skills and services, rather than consummption and disposal.The drive to meet weight based targets could well point to the well publicised issue of contamination in recycling. Whereas recycling targets should be ambitious, maybe the metrics regarding quality need to be addressed. Quality is key to the recycling industry. Many schemes produce good quality material, but when it is low quality this can lead to extensive and costly sorting by reprocessors before the material can be recycled.At the Co-op we measure success of recyclability at product level rather than by weight. So we have a target to get to 80% of our products being easy to recyclable by 2020. This is more aligned to what the customers actually see in store.The recycling metrics at the moment are measured in weight, which does result in some slightly perverse incentives to collect the heavier recycled materials (ie wet grass clippings). We would like to see a move to measures which encourage the recycling industry to target materials that have the most intrinsic environmental value or scarcity (ie plastics, aluminium or rare earth metals) rather than chasing volume and weight. The point about newspapers is an interesting one - because it shifts the type of materials that need capturing and recycling. In the future, we'll need to incentivise the recycling of computers, tablets and the materials that make them rather than newspapers. 3.45pm GMT A couple of interesting questions from twitter about the not-so-good image of the waste and recycling sector:#askGSB bin, waste, trashcan, garbage all have negative connotations that suggest the material is no longer of value...#askgsb: We need to involve the #creativecommunity to turn around image of #recycling, #reuse etc, its appeal needs a #makeoverI completely agree that plastic packaging waste is seen as a negative, whereas in reality it is a highly valuable and local resource that UK manufacturers need to put back into making more products. It makes economic sense that we use UK resources for UK manufacture and avoid using unnecessary virgin materials.Yes! Definitely got thoughts on this one. That's our whole aim at Remade, instead of blaiming people for wasting too much, encouraging people to see the benefits of reuse and repair. Repair creates 10 times as many jobs as recycling, and we help folk learn and share skills, connect in the community, make friends at our community repair centre and make creative use of stuff that would otherwise go to landfill. Put simply - it makes people feel good.When I shared this article I wrote about creating a network of community repair centres in the UK it got thousands of shares and positive comments. This is our big vision:Internally, at least, we've stopped referring to the materials we collect as waste - we refer to \"resources\", which is exactly what these materials are, even the stuff in our black bins. We need consistency of communication from all stakeholders (particularly Government) to reinforce that this material isn't waste.

Genes do constrain our fate, as does luck, even if development matters more. The way that our capacities develop is profoundly influenced by the environment and by the social situation in which a child grows up. Genetic influence is not genetic determinism and the interplay between genes and development is enormously complicated. A study based on the population of Iceland at first sight makes claims to show that some genes for intelligence are being pushed out of the population. On closer inspection it shows just how tangled these questions are. Researchers have identified a large number of gene variants \u2013 the evolutionary mutations associated with traits \u2013 which, taken together, correlate with educational attainment (with the caveat that some variants might simply improve self-control and foresight). The work shows these same variants are also associated with having fewer children.Since evolution can be defined as a change\u00a0in how common these variants are found in populations over time, this looks superficially as if we are evolving to be less clever. Nature however is swamped by nurture: environmental pressures are working much more strongly in the other direction. There is in IQ testing a phenomenon called the Flynn effect, in which successive generations in every population tested have shown significantly higher IQ scores than their parents. In Iceland, the Flynn effect raises IQ points by about 10 points every generation, while the genetic process identified by the latest research is 30 times as weak. If we extrapolate the Flynn effect backwards in time, so that IQ diminishes in the past at the same rate as it has been increasing in our time, it appears that the Victorians would have trouble reading and writing while Elizabethans would scarcely have been able to produce articulate speech. So much for Shakespeare. On the other hand, the genetic curve, traced back the same way,\u00a0would suggest that the Elizabethans were all towering geniuses among whom Shakespeare would have been completely unremarkable. Clearly we are not measuring fixed and long-term versions of intelligence in either case.

Its electoral coalition embraces younger and black and minority ethnic voters in major cities who are upset, angry, even traumatised by the referendum and its aftermath.

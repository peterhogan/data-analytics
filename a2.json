His fans were delighted, but his relationship with the label collapsed and the album was never formally released.

He has publicly denounced and sacked his manager John Woolf several times, before rehiring him a few days later.

To the onlooker, it might have seemed as if they had only the trees and railings for company. In fact, this was not the case. Arranged at a discreet distance were half a dozen plain-clothes police officers. The situation was like a scene from a film. The rendezvous had been carefully planned. They had taken up their positions at 11.05am. At 11.15am sharp, two women would emerge from a property trailing their shopping trolleys \u2013 unless, of course, the whole thing was an elaborate hoax.The minutes ticked by with agonising slowness. But at the appointed hour precisely, a door did indeed open, and two women appeared, with trolleys. \u201cThey\u2019d described what they would be wearing,\u201d says Hall. \u201cAnd as soon as I saw them, I knew it was all true.\u201d Having embraced them \u2013 Hall is as warm and reassuring a person as you could hope to meet \u2013 she and Stocks took the women to a place of safety, and there, they stuttered through their story. It was the older of the pair, 57-year-old Josephine Herivel, who had made the initial call, dialling a helpline number she had memorised after hearing it on television. The younger woman, who is now known as Katy Morgan-Davies and who was then 30, explained that she had been held captive in Peckford Place and a series of other south London properties from birth. The man responsible for this, they said, was 73-year-old Aravindan Balakrishnan, whom they knew as Comrade B or Bala, the leader of the Workers\u2019 Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, AKA the collective, an organisation with which Herivel had been involved since 1978. They also revealed, increasingly anxious now, that a third woman, 69-year-old Aisha Wahab, remained inside the property. When they broke for sandwiches, the police therefore headed once again to Peckford Place. When the officers returned, it was with Wahab, to the obvious relief of Herivel and Morgan-Davies.

Yet, in this performance by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, and in the context of the US presidential inauguration just hours earlier, the work carried a newly cataclysmic resonance and foreboding that made for a shattering experience. In conversation with Sibelius in Helsinki in 1907, the year after his revision of his sixth, Mahler expressed the belief that \u201cthe symphony must be like the world. It must encompass everything\u201d.

It is immaculately staged by Thom Southerland, but you feel that Yeston and Stone had more success with Titanic in making a musical out of seemingly intractable material. The show, based on a 1924 play, involves Death taking the form of a handsome Russian prince and spending a weekend on the shores of Lake Garda with an aristocratic Italian family: supposedly a great leveller, Death here appears something of a social snob. The big question is whether, when he vanishes on the stroke of midnight, he will take with him Grazia, the daughter of the house. However, since Grazia \u2013 to borrow a Keatsian phrase \u2013 is more than half in love with easeful Death, there is little tension.

It\u2019s the universal myth of the Rite of Spring, which has long fascinated artists from Hans Christian Andersen to Igor Stravinsky. It is also an example of opera\u2019s recurring fascination with the person \u2013 usually a woman \u2013 who finds a love so strong that they are willing to die for it. That\u2019s at the heart of La Traviata and La Boh\u00e8me. The story also has much in common with A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, the great English celebration of the coming of summer and the rekindling of love.

First, there\u2019s Michael Chabon\u2019s Moonglow (Fourth Estate). Taking in radicalism and rocket science, this is a wildly inventive and often very funny novel, and such a relief after its tedious predecessor, Telegraph Avenue. Speaking of tedious, Jonathan Lethem\u2019s career has never quite regained the heights of Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude. The Blot (Jonathan Cape), out in February, tells of a telepathic backgammon shark with a brain tumour. It\u2019s a return to form, absurd and digressive in a way that makes clear Lethem\u2019s debt to Thomas Pynchon. Finally, and most surprisingly, there\u2019s Paul Auster\u2019s 4321 (Faber). Auster is 70 in 2017, which shocked me rather \u2013 I still think of him as a sprightly iconoclast. His new novel is so much better than anything since The Music of Chance, you wonder if it can really be by the same author as Invisible or Oracle Night. This meticulously plotted book weaves four possible stories out of the life of one man \u2013 Ferguson \u2013 who makes his way through the second half of the 20th century being buffeted by forces political and personal. Think a postmodern take on Kate Atkinson\u2019s Life After Life.One\u2019s heart goes out to the contemporary American novelist, for whom daily reality seems to outstrip the reach of both satire and dystopia. All the more impressive that a debutant, Nathan Hill, with his scintillating The Nix (Picador), has given us a character who comes close to out-Trumping Trump. Sheldon Packer is a bilious demagogue, just one of the many pleasures of this engaging story of a mother and son whose private travails become front-page news. Other first novels worth looking out for are Sympathy (One) by Olivia Sudjic, the best fictional account I\u2019ve read of the way the internet has shaped our inner lives. A literary thriller that confirms the arrival of a major new talent. There\u2019s also The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times (Salt) by Xan Brooks \u2013 a fairytale wrapped within a historical novel, it\u2019s as quixotic and dreamlike as Ishiguro\u2019s The Buried Giant. Elif Batuman\u2019s memoir of a life in love with Russian literature, The Possessed, was stunning and her first novel, The Idiot (Cape), is just as good \u2013 a moving, continent-hopping coming-of-age story.

Scott was a veteran of the Australian rock scene \u2013 he\u2019d sung with the Spektors, the Valentines and Fraternity without ever reaching any level of real success. He\u2019d also worked in a fertiliser plant, and in May 1974 had a motorcycle accident \u2013 riding drunk after a row \u2013 that left him in a coma for three days.

The anger at spending years on the fringes and the joy at getting another shot burst through in his lyrics in the early AC/DC records. The group\u2019s first Australian album, High Voltage, came out in February 1975, but their second, TNT (released in December of the same year) was where Scott really found his voice. It opened with It\u2019s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll) and Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Singer, which were pretty much Scott\u2019s manifestoes of the rock\u2019n\u2019roll life \u2013 grubby, dirty, venal, but a whole lot better than the alternative. \u201cWell you can stick your nine-to-five living / And your collar and your tie / And you can stick your moral standards / \u2019Cos it\u2019s all a dirty lie,\u201d he sings on Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Singer, those last two words given an almost camp inflection.

Over the years, they would create their own strange iconography by dressing in Kappa tracksuits, picking song and album titles invoking all from Glasgow gang culture (Mogwai Young Team) to surreal in-jokes (Oh! How the Dogs Stack Up) to, um, Scottish football referees (Hugh Dallas). Arriving two years after they formed, Helicon 1 was one of the first pieces of music Mogwai ever released, a limited-edition single better recognised today for its inclusion on the compilation album Ten Rapid. It made No 2 on John Peel\u2019s 1997 festive 50 (Peel proved instrumental in boosting Mogwai, inviting them for five sessions between 1996 and 2004, some of which are on the 2005 BBC album Government Commissions). Helicon 1 has ever since been an anchor in Mogwai\u2019s live set and the ultimate manifestation of the quiet-loud formula that defined their embryonic phase \u2013 a brutal-sweet symphony which, like the best of Mogwai songs, is poised between giving you a manly hug and sticking the head in you.

And her voice has always really resonated with me. I've been a fan of that song since I was a kid, and realised around the time of creating The Bride show, I realised that song is about a newly wed couple and their journey into living a life together.

My real question is on disappointment, in that do you feel disappointed for how it\u2019s all turned out? During the 60s and 70s in amongst all the crap there was at least a sense of optimism, a glimmer of things getting better, of our society becoming a bit more equal. Around 1975 ish, in my early 20s as a lad from Pilton I sipped sherry one Xmas or some such with admiral Denning, or his brother the Lord one, who had a dose of the horrors when he discovered I was a prol. But at least I got in past the front door. Q. Is it all now stitched up to prevent prols from ever sherry sipping with Lords and Admirals?It is. It has gone back to a kind of Victorian type of society, and it's almost like all the advances after the second world war, all the social advances, have been eradicated. We've gone back to a very elitist ideology, and it's disappointing. Everything's also a reaction though: the new narrative of our time is the new nation state, self-sufficient, eco-friendly, socially progressive. And that's what's going to facilitate real change: not bureaucracies like the EU, not corrupt elitist parliaments like Westminster.

Either I ran with the pack, which I've photographed in the Observer, or I tried to stay on the straight and narrow and eventually escape what was a really violent ghetto at the time. It was by the fortune of this one sunny day that I took my camera and photographed the boys in this derelict building at the end of my street. I took this photo to the Observer newspaper, the editor asked: Did you take this? I said: yes. And they published it. And gave me \u00a350 and it was a king's ransom, the turning point of my whole life. It offered me a life away from the bigotry and ignorance and violence of Finsbury Park. And since then I've managed to publish 30 books, numerous exhibitions. But the final footnote is that I failed my photography test to becomes a RAF photographer. I taught myself everything about photography and darkroom work. It was all based on the foundations of a terrible beginning in my life.

I don't disassociate, I always retain the memory of what I've seen because the memory becomes my white stick, it guides me into the next stage, into the darkroom and releasing my emotions into the print. It might be darker, more sinister. A lot of fear went into my work, I saw dead children, men with their jaws blown away, holes in their throat. This had to be got rid of or I would have post-traumatic stress. Which I don't. But I do have bad dreams. I took my soul and my stress into the darkroom. I belong to this system I've developed.

Could you tell us how much of an influence the blues have had on you, and which bluesmen in particular as well as Big Bill Broonzy please?The American blues in the South was a profound influence on me. One of my most cherished awards is that I'm a Blues Ambassador of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when I was presented the Slim Harpo award. I think it's the simplicity - as I said earlier, it's a protest forum, that can touch on very emotive issues, for example Big Bill Broonzy's If You're Black Get Back Get Back was incredible important for its time. But you don't have to be from the American South to be a bluesman. One of my great friends and inspirations was a man called Davey Graham, who I believe was mixed race but sang the blues in an almost London accent. No American affectation whatsover. And he still conveyed the emotions of the blues without resorting to the American accent. When the Kinks first started we were often reported as saying we sing blues, but we don't sing in American accents. We tried to retain our Englishness.Davey Graham was from Scotland I believe.

To be serious, Marx's big mistake in trying to marry Hegel to Ricardo was to believe in the inexorable polarisation of wealth distribution.

Recently, I was in a cinema when the trailer for T2, the new Trainspotting film, was played. The whole room erupted into cheers. Perhaps your excitement is not as delirious. There are many who are dismissing the film before it\u2019s even been screened. But I have a feeling that your anticipation levels are linked to how you spent your 1990s. Trainspotting, the 1996 original, remains the quintessential mid-90s movie. Like Oasis and Blur, like Kate Moss and love doves and Firestarter, it was of its time and captured that time\u2019s cynical yet optimistic, hedonistic heart. Though the story was about heroin addicts, the feel of the film recalled different drugs: uppers, hallucinogens, ecstasy. There were real-unreal trippy sequences about losing pills in a toilet or going cold turkey; uplifting, rushy ones about clubbing and having sex. Plus fantastic music: Iggy Pop, Primal Scream, Leftfield. Trainspotting wasn\u2019t shallow, but it didn\u2019t dwell; it was always moving, like a long, clever pop video.The characters were people you felt you already knew. There was Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle, the booze-fuelled, unpredictable psycho, a small-town Scottish version of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas. Spud (Ewen Bremner): hapless, surreal, a lovable, smackhead loser. Sexy Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), out for whatever he could get, mostly women and drugs. And Renton, played by Ewan McGregor, the heroined-up antihero, who kept kicking drugs and then going back, and doing the same to his mates, until he finally robbed them all (except Spud) and ran away. What\u2019s remarkable about Trainspotting is that even if you haven\u2019t watched the film in years (I hadn\u2019t), you\u2019ll remember each character\u2019s defining scene. Begbie\u2019s was the freeze-frame where he chucked a beer glass over his shoulder into a packed pub. Spud\u2019s was the whizzed-up job interview (\u201cmy pleasure in other people\u2019s leisure\u201d) and the unfortunate bedclothes-across-the-breakfast-table moment. Sick Boy, the slipperiest of a selection of born-slippy characters: snogging a girl with an E on his tongue.

In the 1950s, Cold War paranoia led to a spate of films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers about aliens hiding among us, looking to destroy humanity from within. Later the chaos and bloodshed of the Vietnam war inspired a cycle of cynical, anarchic and bloody movies such as Tobe Hooper\u2019s Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wes Craven\u2019s Last House On the Left, in which the rules of civilised society collapse amid senseless, numbing violence. Horror cinema, with its in-built tropes of shock and tension, has always provided a convenient way for culture to process real-life fears.This is why Resident Evil 7, released this week to much critical acclaim, is an interesting benchmark for where horror video games are right now, and what they say about the world around us.

And no, there are no special options because you chose an IVA over being declared bankrupt \u2013 both are still forms of insolvency. An IVA is a formal agreement to repay your creditors at an amount you can afford. If your creditors agree to the IVA it becomes legally binding.

Genes do constrain our fate, as does luck, even if development matters more. The way that our capacities develop is profoundly influenced by the environment and by the social situation in which a child grows up. Genetic influence is not genetic determinism and the interplay between genes and development is enormously complicated. A study based on the population of Iceland at first sight makes claims to show that some genes for intelligence are being pushed out of the population. On closer inspection it shows just how tangled these questions are. Researchers have identified a large number of gene variants \u2013 the evolutionary mutations associated with traits \u2013 which, taken together, correlate with educational attainment (with the caveat that some variants might simply improve self-control and foresight). The work shows these same variants are also associated with having fewer children.Since evolution can be defined as a change\u00a0in how common these variants are found in populations over time, this looks superficially as if we are evolving to be less clever. Nature however is swamped by nurture: environmental pressures are working much more strongly in the other direction. There is in IQ testing a phenomenon called the Flynn effect, in which successive generations in every population tested have shown significantly higher IQ scores than their parents. In Iceland, the Flynn effect raises IQ points by about 10 points every generation, while the genetic process identified by the latest research is 30 times as weak. If we extrapolate the Flynn effect backwards in time, so that IQ diminishes in the past at the same rate as it has been increasing in our time, it appears that the Victorians would have trouble reading and writing while Elizabethans would scarcely have been able to produce articulate speech. So much for Shakespeare. On the other hand, the genetic curve, traced back the same way,\u00a0would suggest that the Elizabethans were all towering geniuses among whom Shakespeare would have been completely unremarkable. Clearly we are not measuring fixed and long-term versions of intelligence in either case.

They ought to provide stable reference points that everyone \u2013 no matter what their politics \u2013 can agree on. Yet in recent years, divergent levels of trust in statistics has become one of the key schisms that have opened up in western liberal democracies. Shortly before the November presidential election, a study in the US discovered that 68% of Trump supporters distrusted the economic data published by the federal government. In the UK, a research project by Cambridge University and YouGov looking at conspiracy theories discovered that 55% of the population believes that the government \u201cis hiding the truth about the number of immigrants living here\u201d.Rather than diffusing controversy and polarisation, it seems as if statistics are actually stoking them. Antipathy to statistics has become one of the hallmarks of the populist right, with statisticians and economists chief among the various \u201cexperts\u201d that were ostensibly rejected by voters in 2016.

Another question then asked how people would vote if Labour said it would implement Brexit anyway, like the Tories and Ukip, and only the Lib Dems said they would give parliament the final say.Last week Theresa May said parliament would have a vote on the EU exit terms \u2013 but the choice would be between accepting the terms and leaving on WTO terms. An ICM poll conducted this weekend across Labour constituencies shows that the party would be 22 seats better off in a 2017 election if it supported parliament also having the option of the UK remaining within the EU.If Labour opposes the government and calls for parliament to have a choice between accepting the deal and remaining in the EU, it would end up with 162 seats (compared to the 175 currently projected). However, if it just supports the government it would end up with 140 seats (both scenarios assume the Lib Dems call for parliamentary choice). In the first scenario Labour\u2019s share of the vote falls 3% from the currently projected share of 44% in Labour constituencies to 41%; but if it supports the government its share falls 8% from 44% to 36%, with the Lib Dems gaining a similar amount.
